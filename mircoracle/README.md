# mircoracle


**MircOracle** is a Machine Learning library implemented with the [Groovy programming language](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)

The library has several parts: a tree-based dictionary predictor (ContinuationDictionary), a Factor Oracle class and components to navigate and generate sequences. The implementation is based on the algorithms described in several papers, see the References section for details.
