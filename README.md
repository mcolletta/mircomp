It consists of several components: syntax highlighted code editor with autocomplete, graphical score viewer, MIDI editor, folder viewer, scripting capabilities, soundfonts selector.


### MirChord

MirChord is a powerful but easy-to-learn textual notation language tailored for assisted/algorithmic music composition.
Crafting a score with MirChord is very simple thanks to its peculiar traits like: relative octave entry, sticky duration, leadsheet-style chord symbols, unpitched notes and percussion instruments, automatic note splitting for measures and automatic beaming, universal key with solfeggio syllables and Roman numerals, etc...

It allows to navigate a score just by dragging the mouse (panning mode) and supports pagination and zooming. Moreover, you can control the playback position by point and click on a staff and visualize the progression of the MIDI execution with the automatic update of a graphical control element (follow playback mode).
