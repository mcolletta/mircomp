	The Score Viewer is used for the graphical preview of scores.<br/>
	There are three main modes for the application. In <em>Pan</em> mode the user can move inside the score by dragging the mouse. The <em>Select</em> mode allows the composer to set the playback position by clicking on a staff. During the <em>MIDI Playback</em> a graphical score element that represents the current position is updated.<br/>
	The component supports pagination and zooming as well (during the playback they are adjusted to show the current portion of the score being executed).
