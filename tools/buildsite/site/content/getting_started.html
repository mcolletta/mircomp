	<h4>Create a new score</h4>
	<p class="spaced">
		We are almost ready to write our first composition.<br/>
		There are two ways to start composing. <br/>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The simplest choice is to create a new mirchord file and edit the score using the MirChord notation. In this case there will be a special window divided in two panes with a syntax highlighted code editor and a score viewer and MIDI player.
			</li>
			<li>
				On the other hand, it is possible to create a new MIDI file and in this case you can start composing by means of a full-blown MIDI sequencer and editor.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Using the MirChord notation language</h4>
	<p class="spaced">
		Examples are a conventient way to explore the software capabilities and in this short tutorial you are invited to cut and paste the first four measures of <em>Invention n. 1</em> by the well known German composer and musician <em>Johann Sebastian Bach</em>

	    You can visit the <a href="mirchord.html">reference page</a> for details about MirChord.

	<h4>Create a score using the MirMidi sequencer.</h4>
	<p class="spaced">
		As stated above the other option is to create a new MIDI file or open an exisisting one (there are tons of them over the Internet).<br/>
		In this case the MIDI editor shows up.
	</p>
	<p class="bg-info spaced">
	    For a MirComp project (see below) you can import an existing file into the <em>midi</em> folder of the project by means of the <mark>Import...</mark> command of the mouse menu over the specific tree folder.

	    You can visit the <a href="mirmidi.html">MirMidi</a> page for details about the sequencer.

<div class="spaced">
	<h4>Project tree</h4>
	<p class="spaced">
		After a new project is created (or opened) on the left side of the IDE you can find the project tree.<br/>
		Projects created with the wizard share a common structure and have at least these common folders that serve a distinct purpose inside the project.<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>The <em>mirchords</em> folder will contain all the compositions of the project.</li>
			<li>The <em>src</em> folder is the folder where you can put your groovy scripts.</li>
			<li>The <em>midi</em> folder is for MIDI files.</li>
			<li>The <em>lib</em> folder is reserved for external jars file (if any).</li>
