	The Java Virtual Machine by default uses a low quality "emergency" soundbank to play midi sequence.<br/>
	To improve the quality of the compositions it is highly advised to load some high quality sample sounds in the form of a <em>SoundFonts .sf2</em> file.<br/>
	In the <a target="_blank" href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfonts-and-sfz-files">SoundFonts | MuseScore</a> page you can find a list of interesting soundfons and the links to download them.

	It is very simple.<br/>
	First you must download a sf2 file and save it in a location of your choice in the filesystem.<br/>
	To load this file into the project open the <mark>properties dialog</mark> from the IDE and choose as <mark>Soundbank path</mark> the file previously saved.<br/>
	Press <mark>Apply</mark> and <mark>Reload</mark>.
